`Next.js` is used to create the `React` app structure with server-side rendering (SSR). `TypeScript` is the language used in the project to ensure type safety. `HTML` and `CSS` have been used to create the structure and the styling of the user interface (UI) with `Tailwind CSS` so that utility class is used to avoid the cascading mess due to specificity conflicts. And `D3.js` has been used to create data-driven documents to achieve data visualization with maximum flexibility.
